- **FIX:**  Updated BMA control to properly work with Double Tap, method is there for Wrist tilt, no motion setup for it at present.
- **ADD:**  Functionality to block Non-Volatile Storage from being used, will erase and reboot the Watchy and stop using it for this Watchy face.
- **FIX:**  Corrected NTP server to pool.ntp.org, it should work globally, though it does have a restriction on use, so expect it to fail if used too much.

**Version 1.3.7:**

- **FIX:**  Recognize Countdown Timer is in use during Screen Blanking and not use atMinuteWake, but nextMinuteWake instead.
- **ADD:**  All Screen Blanking now use atMinuteWake when Countdown Timer is not in use, this works by waking at minutes 0 and 30 or the next Alarm minute.
- **FIX:**  makeTime and breakTime introduce a month and week day starting with 1, which is incorrect, versions from SmallRTC & SmallNTP now fix this issue, so January 29 will not be seen as February 29 by the RTCs.

**Version 1.4:**
- **FIX:**  Corrected the orientation of the display with the accelerometer.
- **ADD:**  Added Wrist Tilt support for all Screen Blanking with "Screen on Hold" (actively watches your wrist to turn screen off again, heavy battery usage).

- **FIX:**  Moved Button PINs to Defines_GSR to a different value from Watchy base's defines to avoid conflicts and to correct them based on RTC and not static.

**Version 1.4.3D:**

**Version 1.4.3J:**
- **FIX:**  Moved the pinMode code until after the setting of the nextMinuteWake to repair the issue with the PCF8563 not waking, thanks to ZeroKelvinKeyboard for the find.

**Version 1.4.6A:**
- **FIX:**  Fixed UTC update not confusing minute changes when Countdown or Elapsed Timer is/are in use.
- **ADD:**  Added a function for override use called ClockSeconds(), updates the WatchTime.UTC and WatchTime.Local with current time.

- **FIX:**  Redesign main loop to be single passthrough instead of multiple, reduced code and made stable.
- **ADD:**  Added Inverts for Design to allow Status and Battery to be inverted from current ForeColor.
- **ADD:**  Added (and fixed the default Design) GSR_AutoFore which replaces the GxEPD_BLACK on Design elements, allowing Design elements to follow current ForeColor automatically.

- **FIX:**  Internet connectivity speed increased greatly, IP address should happen within a second of connection.
- **FIX:**  TimeZone, NTP and Weather should all collect data within a few seconds instead of close to 15 seconds.

- **ADD:**  Menuing system now includes a cursor to show position and offers toggles for certain options (White is on, Black is off in some cases).
- **ADD:**  NTP Auto Sync, allows the Watchy_GSR to wake the Watchy up for an NTP Sync.  NTP Syncs do *NOT* work when Drift Calculation is in progress.
- **FIX:**  Threaded Alarm & Haptic Feedback system fixed to reduce interference with Watchy operation.  Reboots cause Haptic feedback.
- **ADD:**  Step Counter now is stored each minute to NVS, so upon a reboot, progress shouldn't be lost.
- **ADD:**  NTP and Weather can now wake the Watchy on interval while Screen Blanking is active, to run their respective requests.
- **FIX:**  Included current PinMode setup before DeepSleep.
- **FIX:**  Cleaned up DeepSleep function, so that less work is done.

- **FIX:**  WiFi requests are terminated if WatchFace is changed during use to avoid cross-contamination between WatchFaces.
- **FIX:**  Default Design style for Watchy_GSR is now used in initWatchFaceStyle to avoid accidental WatchFaces having no Design elements and winding up with a blank screen with no fonts.

**Version 1.4.7A:**
- **FIX:**  Fixed the battery indicator on screen blanking.
- **FIX:**  Fixed the AskForWiFi not allowing multiple requests from one watch face.
- **FIX:**  Removed CleanJSON that was interfering with JSON data requests.

- **ADD:**  IsMetric function to find out of the weather scale is Metric or not.

**Version 1.4.7B:**
- **FIX:**  Fixed the battery indicator on screen blanking FINALLY!
- **FIX:**  Fixed the OTA Website and OTA Update so that they don't try to connect too fast via WiFi (which can cause a crash or brownout if done too fast).
- **ADD:**  drawStatus() now has a Screen Blanking method that also now includes (for both), a Joystick icon showing the current active game "wants your attention".
- **FIX:**  Added a ForceInputs() function that does the pinModes for the pins that need it (and not a loop for pins that don't).
- **ADD:**  The missing weather information (Clouds, Sunrise, Sunset, Pressure and Visibility) converted (if possible) to the unit selection currently in use.
- **ADD:**  A function for changing the current Watchface forward or backward through the list, will return true if it actually switched.
- **ADD:**  Migrated all the settings for Watchface Styles into 1 byte instead of 4 bools to save RTC Memory space, which includes new functions to set and retrieve those states.
- **FIX:**  AskForWiFi() won't attempt to start the WiFi interface while the notification motor is active to avoid brownouts.

**Version 1.4.7C:**
- **FIX:**  Battery Detection for charging has changed, now using a float level system, should stop fantom charging indications.
- **ADD:**  inBrownOut code to avoid overtaxing the battery during WiFi and other uses to reduce draw.  FreeRTOS BrownOut Detection is disabled.
- **FIX:**  Leftover variable IDidIt from old loop replaced in 1.4.7 was blocking `InsertOnMinute` has been removed as it wasn't supposed to be there.
- **FIX:**  Alarms not firing when Drift correction would reduce the time by 1 second at RTC read when an alarm woke the Watchy up, now has a WfNM (Wait for New Minute) flag for the main loop that only goes `false` when a new minute happens.
- **ADD:**  Added configuration changes for keeping track of 2 Drift Values.
- **ADD:**  Drift Value editing, so it can be altered after Drift Calculation has finished.  This helps with accuracy, see SmallRTC on Drift Calculation for more information on how to edit this value.
- **FIX:**  Fixed Edit RTC's BACK button usage, was missing screen update requests which caused random jumps of 2 to 3 digits from previous spot.
- **ADD:**  WiFi indicator will now have a ! at the end to denote it is "attempting to connect" to that AP, when the ! disappears, it is connected.
- **ADD:**  BrownOut limiter to slow WiFi and other functions down in the event the battery level drops too much during operation, some functions may slow down considerably as battery level drops.
- **ADD:**  Added threaded button detection, which helps improve button response.
- **FIX:**  Fixed Alarms to be more global in response.
- **FIX:**  Fixed Battery state causng non-Screen Blanking modes to keep Watchy awake for minutes.
- **FIX:**  Sorted the lower menu items so that the WiFi functions are all together, made no sense offering WiFi settings when WiFi isn't available.
- **ADD:**  With the inclusion of CPU ID detection, features unavailable will be absent if they do not exist on the current CPU.

**Version 1.4.7C:**
- **FIX:**  Fixed Watchy Connect to have no password to avoid TKIP connection issues (use with caution, recommend lowering WiFi transmission power to 7db and move it close to your device).
- **FIX:**  Fixed Watchy Connect Menu option, pressing BACK now will tell you to WAIT.  The OTA Website will also do the same thing.  3 seconds later, you will be properly out.
- **FIX:**  Battery Detection was incorrectly saving state during WiFi usage and would either say it was charging incorrectly, but will still show LOW battery.
- **ADD:**  AddOn functions BMAAvailable() and BMATemperature(bool Metric) to allow AddOns access to tell if the BMA was compiled in or not and access to the temperature sensor.
- **FIX:**  Override Information was lacking changes and now reflects the correct function list.
