# **PROPER OVERRIDE & WATCHFACE ADDON DESIGN**

Don't edit Watchy_GSR.cpp or Watchy_GSR.h, instead, edit GSR.ino as all of the overriding can be done within that file, this way that one file can be used as your project file, allowing you to override the necessary parts of the Watchy_GSR without having to re-edit updates.  Just remember to backup your GSR.ino project file before updating (to ensure you don't lose it by accident).

**NOTES ON WiFi**

If you plan to use WiFi, remember, users will want to actually keep using the Watchy_GSR underneath while you're using WiFi, so while it is nice to pack everything in at once, the `InsertWiFi()` function is repeatedly called until you tell it you're done by saying `EndWiFi()`.

Breaking up your WiFi functions so that they're only done in parts is best.  Anything you have to wait for, make an int that tells you where you are in your work and when `InsertWiFi()` returns, continue where you left off.  Recommend an int variable being set to 1 when you `AskForWiFi()`, then when `InsertWiFi()` is called, you do part of the work, ++ the int and exit the function, when `InsertWiFi()` returns again, repeat until you're finished.  When you finish, call `EndWiFi()`.  When you receive an `InsertWiFiEnd()`, set your int to 0 after cleaning up anything you need to, this way, your code will always work properly.  You can even test in `InsertOnMinute()` if your int is 0 before commencing so you don't try twice.  `AskForWiFi()` and `EndWiFi()` will only work once per WatchFace, if the WatchFace is changed mid-WiFi use, `EndWiFi()` will be called between the switching to the new WatchFace.

# **Version 1.4.2 Additions**

The addition of the following functions will allow overriding both the original Watch Styles or adding to them, the author's choice.  This is all done without writing any changes to the Watchy_GSR base code, so as to avoid having to re-apply changes to that code after version changes.

Overriding `InsertDefaults()` function, you can call this function:

`AllowDefaultWatchStyles({true}/false);` // Will state if you want the original Watch Styles (Index 0 (Classic GSR) and 1 (Ballsy) to be used first).

Just after the default Watch Styles are added (if told to), another function will be called:

***$*** `InsertAddWatchStyles()` // Use this function to add Watch Styles starting from Index 0 [`AllowDefaultWatchStyles(false)`] or from Index 2 if allowing default Watch Styles.

`uint8_t AddWatchStyle(string StyleName[,CLASS OBJECT])` // Will return the Index of the added Watch Style (255 = error), 30 character max limit on Watch Style name.

Override these two functions to add your Init and Draw for the Watch Styles:

`void InsertInitWatchStyle(uint8_t StyleID)`  // The init function as seen at the end of Watchy_GSR.cpp.

`void InsertDrawWatchStyle(uint8_t StyleID)`  // The Draw function as seen at the bottom of Watchy_GSR.cpp.

Overriding in this manner can be done using a switch and only checking for your Indexes, but you could also just as easily use an IF statement and record your Watch Styles in uint8_t variables for each during ***$*** `InsertAddWatchStyles()`.  The best part about this is, all of this is done PRIOR to the settings reload from NVS (if not disabled), so your chosen Watch Style will remain after a reboot.

# **Version 1.4.3 Additions**

`void InsertNTPServer()` { return "Your favorite NTP Server"; } // Will let you pick your favorite NTP server.

# **Version 1.4.3E Changes**

Removed `void InsertBitmap()`

`void OverrideBitmap()` { return true/{false}; } // This function lets you stop the Design.Face.Bitmap from drawing if you return `true`.

`void OverrideSleepBitmap()` { return true/{false}; } // This function lets you stop the Design.Face.SleepBitmap from drawing if you return `true`.

# **Version 1.4.4 Additions**

Locale and Menu Override are the main offerings available, instructions will be forthcoming for the Locale setup.  For Menu Overriding, users can tell Watchy GSR that they'll handle the Menu button, can also call `ShowDefaultMenu()` to bring the Watchy GSR Default Menu up for usage when wanted, if the author makes a mistake or there is a bug, the standard Watchy GSR Default Menu can be called up by holding the Menu button down for 10 seconds.

# **Version 1.4.4 Additions**

getButtonPins() has 4 new values:  MENU + UP = 5, BACK + UP = 6, DOWN + MENU = 7 and DOWN + BACK = 8
This is currently in **BETA** but the functionality is 100% stable, just the button press duration may be too short to catch both buttons properly.

# **Version 1.4.6 Additions**

`bool InsertNeedAwake(bool GoingAsleep)` { return true/{false}; } // This function runs 3 times per loop, lets you tell the Watchy to stay Awake (Active Mode), you can also run code in this as part of the main loop while in Active Mode.  Return value tells the Watchy to stay in Active Mode (Awake = `true`).

# **Version 1.4.7 Additions**

WatchFace AddOns can be created and included into GSR.ino starting at line 2 in the file (past the .h include at the top), each file can be added in succession to add more AddOn WatchFaces.

**BUTTON MIXING**

| Button | Values |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| SW1 | 1 |
| SW2 | 2 |
| SW3 | 3 |
| SW4 | 4 |
| SW1 + SW3 | 5 |
| SW2 + SW3 | 6 |
| SW1 + SW4 | 7 |
| SW2 + SW4 | 8 |

`getButtonPins()` reads the active pins, for button pressing sanity with debounce the `CheckButtons()` is automatically called during the Active Mode loop, it maps the button(s) pressed back to the Button value.

\
**How to Make Your Own Version**

First, use the Library Manager and give it a release zip, this will install Watchy_GSR as a library, go into the Watchy_GSR library and move the GSR.ino out of it and place it into where your project is.  Rename it to something like MyGSR.ino and edit it, you can do all of your overrides in that.  That ino file now becomes your main compile file.

If you're updating Watchy_GSR, be sure to remove the GSR.ino from it after the Library Manager has imported everything.

\
**How to make your own WatchFace AddOn**

First thing you need to do is to download the EmptyAddOn.h from the Addons folder and follow the commented instructions within, once you've done so, you merely include your newly created AddOn.h into your GSR.ino (after the first include) and compile.  If all goes well, your new WatchFace AddOn will be in the list of Styles in the Options menu.  AddOns are not limited to 1 WatchFace Style per file, you can create multiple styles in 1 file, instructions on how to do this are in the EmptyAddOn.h file.  For Game AddOns, see the EmptyGameAddOn.h, which has the same information with more for setting up a "basic game".
