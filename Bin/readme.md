This is the current bin files that can be uploaded to the Watchy via OTA, either by using a tool or by using a firmware that supports OTA upgrades.

Be sure to pick the right version for the version of your Watchy, as V3 uses an ESP32S3 which is not compatible on the ESP32, choose the right bin file!

If already using Watchy_GSR, you can use OTA Website and upload the bin to the Watchy from a local file using the Watchy Website at the IP address shown on the Watchy.
