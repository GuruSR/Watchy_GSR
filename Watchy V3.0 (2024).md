__**Watchy V3 (2024)**__

Watchy GSR has been designed to be "free floating" in a way that it is adaptable to versions that come up over time.  The V3.0 Watchy (2024) is no exception, as I have had some information on it for a while, but was delayed due to not actually having a V3 (that has changed).


In order to compile and upload to the V3, you need to orientate the device in your hand so the USB port is on the left side and hold it vertically so the top is UP.  This is orientated so the "top" buttons (left is Cancel/Back and right is UP) are easy to access. For actually compiling and uploading the firmware, make sure to read the full Read Me at the start of the repo and the Compilation Instructions.txt in the src folder.


To upload a new firmware to the V3, you have to first manually put the Watchy into Bootloader (firmware upload/serial debug) Mode.  Then upload the Firmware to the device and then manually Reset the Watchy.


Press and hold the top two buttons (left: Cancel/Back) and (right:UP) for 5 seconds (your operating system may make a notice sound that a USB device changed):


Let GO of the LEFT button first to enter Bootloader (firmware upload/serial debug) Mode.

Let GO of the RIGHT button first to Reset the Watchy.
